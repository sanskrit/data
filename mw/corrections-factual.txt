    headword 'iti' (L=28747) changed to have accent.
    Also, the occurences of 'iti' in the body of 28747 also had accent added.
2010-03-22: James Fitzgerald
Hi, I've just noticed that in both the online MW and the image of the dictionary the udatta accent on the first syllable of iti is missing. As a look at the Petersburg dictionary will confirm, the first syllalbe of iti should have, in roman script, an acute mark over it. This was MW's error, and he failed to correct it in his corrigenda. I imagine it's not possible to correct the scanned image, but the online dictionary should be made correct.

2010-03-29: Peter Scharf
 I think it is proper to make factual corrections to the dictionary if and when we can track the correction as a correction for users.  The tracked correction would indicate the editor who made the correction, when, the type of correction (factual, etc. as Jim Funderburk, Malcolm, and I discussed some time ago), and reference to an authority.  I know Jim Funderburk tracks this information but we don't yet have a means to display it.  In this case Jim Fitz. cites as authority Bohtlingk and Roth.  I haven't had a chance to check the occurence in accented texts myself.  Have you Jim Fitzgerald?

2010-03-29: James Fitzgerald
Yes, I'm looking at RV 10.71.11d right now:
the sa?hita text "yajñásya m?tra? ví mimita u tva?" [ALTERNATE TRANSCRIPTION] // yajJa(udatta)sya mA(udatta)trAM vi(udatta) mimIta u tvaH // 
 
is glossed in the padapatha at its very end with  "| ví | mimIte | u? íti | tva? |"  // vi(udatta) | mimIte | uM i(udatta)ti | tvaH | //.
 
I was led to check the dictionary because the Satapatha Brahma?a passage I was reading at the time was inconsistent and had a typo or two regarding the accent of íti. It had several other correct instances. E.g. of correct passage: SB 11.4.3.6 "sárasvati tvá??a rup??i sámanaktu yajñáir íti"
 
[ALTERNATE TRANSCRIPTION]  //sa(udatta)rasvatI tva(udatta)STA rUpA(udatta)Ni sa(udatta)manaktu yajJa(udatta)ir i(udatta)ti //

2010-03-30: Peter Scharf
I think we should make a factual correction to MW.

 L=224192.  Change 'SAT' to 'SaW' in body.
2010-02-04: Jim Funderburk 

Thomas/Peter -
  The following seems like a 'factual' error (typo) in MW. If so, I would like to correct the online MW.
 
  Look up 'zvaTh' (slp = SvaW).
  There are two variants.
  The first is L=224192, which refers the reader to the 2nd variant of 'zAth'.  However, there is no 'zAth' (slp = SAT).
  However, there is a 2nd variant of 'zaTh' (slp = SaW), which references the 1st variant of 'zvaTh'.
 
   Thus, I think slp 'SAT' should be changed to 'SaW' in record L=224192, and this should be added to our
   list of 'factual errors' (which includes typos) in MW.
 
 Do you concur?

2010-02-26: Peter Scharf

Yes, I agree.  It is clear from the DhP. of Westergaard which you made so conveniently accessible.

kadru/kadrU  Supplement record L=326470 corrects kadru/U to kadrU, that is deletes the us from (us , Us) in L=42900.  The same should also be done in L=42899.  Here's why:  According to 326480 the reference for kadrU is RV.  This is correct.  The only place kadrU occurs in RV is RV. viii , 45 , 26 as mentioned in L=42899.  Verified by a search on kadr[auvUoO] in RVall.slp (a text-only accentless digital file of the Rgveda.  The designation of the stem as short as well as long (us , Us) in RV in L=42899 is therefore incorrect and has no evidence since the only reference in RV has it long.  The term trikadrukezu has short 'u', but that is a different word.

kAraka  Supplement record L=327600 "(erase accent)." corrects k/Araka to kAraka in records L=48515, L=48516, L=48517.  Sharon implemented this for the first.  Peter reversed this based upon the importance MW Intro. xviii lays on accent and the accent 6.1.193 provides for the affix Rvul.  The affix Rvuc is rare and occurs only in the feminine and its senses do not appear to be among the meanings listed in the definition of kAraka.

57. 19 Oct 2012
Dfzwa  Supplement record L=334490 changes the accent.  Sharon asks whether it should also be changed in compounds.  Peter removed the accent from the compounds since it is just inherited in the digital dictionary while in print, judging from the compounds with vowel initial words where sandhi is done, accent is not inherited.  In fact the accent of these words would be determined by compound sandhi rules.  In many cases (bahuvrIhi compounds) it should be identical according to rules, but does this rule extend to proper names?  These words are not cited in accented texts.

Kim Plofker noted to pms:
Takao Hayashi's Bakhshali Manuscript (1995) has a very helpful discussion on pp. 64-70 of various attested instances of words for powers of 10.  The standard value for arbuda does seem to be 10^7 or ten million, so I'd like to see the argument or evidence adduced for changing it to a different value.  For nikharva, though, 10^11 or a hundred billion is apparently more accepted than 10^10, so a change would seem to be in order.

This requested by Peter Scharf, who provides the
following comment:
The grave accent mark is the typical way of Romanizing the svarita accent 
in Sanskrit.  The reason is was chosen is because it graphically represents a 
falling tone, which is how the ancient Indian phonetic treatises describe the 
svarita.  It is NOT the way the Sanskrit Library has chosen.  
The SL has chosen the circumflex/carot character instead because this is the 
symbol generally used for the accent in European languages.  Furthermore the 
logic of the choice of the grave accent mark for svarita is not cogent.  
The acute accent is used by Sanskrit scholars for the transcription of the 
udAtta accent, which is not a rising tone but a high tone.  The svarita is 
represented by a vertical stroke, not a sloping stroke, in the Indian 
traditions where the svarita is the highest tone, even where it is not 
described as a falling tone but as a tone higher than udAtta.  The vertical 
stroke is also used for the udAtta in traditions where the udAtta is the 
highest tone.  In any case, the grave accent mark in MW represents a svarita, 
not an anudAtta.  The Cologne data-entry merged grave and acute accent marks 
in the acute mark throughout.  Only two marks are necessary to mark three 
accents in the European transcription; the acute accent mark marked the udAtta,
 the grave accent mark marked an independent svarita, the  anudAtta and 
dependent svarita were left unmarked.
